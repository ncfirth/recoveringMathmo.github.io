<p>This is a short post as it is a link to an earlier blog post that I wrote using medium.</p>

<p>In the Medium post I discuss using text to represent molecules and then training an RNN to generate new molecules.</p>

<p>The link to the article is <a href="https://medium.com/@nf508/de-novo-design-without-the-chemistry-d183e8a9f150#.ht9t2ydk4">here</a>.</p>
