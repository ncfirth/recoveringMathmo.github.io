                    <p></p>
                    <h8>Echoes Around The Home is a cross disciplinary project conceived and led by Dr Nicholas Firth (UCL Computer Science), working with social scientists Prof. Mary Pat Sullivan (Nipissing University Applied and Professional Studies) and Emma Harding (UCL Institute of Neurology), neuropsychologist Prof. Sebastian Crutch (UCL Institute of Neurology) and computer scientist Prof. Daniel Alexander (UCL Computer Science). This project has been funded by a Social Science Plus+ award from The Collaborative Social Science Domain UCL and will begin installing Echo’s in late March.</h8>

                <p>In the last two years, major advances in voice recognition have led to an increasing number of people using voice-controlled devices in their homes. The Amazon Echo is currently the most popular voice-controlled device in the home, with 5.1 million devices sold by November 2016. The Echo’s features include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Plays music, <i>e.g. “Play Eric Clapton”</i></li>
                    <li>Answers questions <i>e.g. “What’s the date today?”</i></li>
                    <li>Reads audiobooks <i>e.g. “Read me Alice in Wonderland”</i></li>
                    <li>Reports news <i>e.g. “Read me the Guardian headlines”</li>
                    <li>Provides schedules <i>e.g. “Is there anything in the calendar this week?”</i></li>
                    <li>Affordable, the cheapest model is currently £50</li>
                </ul>

            <p>A new study, Echoes Around The Home, will trial the use of the Amazon Echo by people living with dementia. The aim is to increase independence and wellbeing by providing simplified access to entertainment, diaries and knowledge, whilst also acting as a means for data collection to monitor disease progression.
            </p>

            <p>For this study, we will ask people with Posterior Cortical Atrophy and a caregiver, to install and use the Amazon Echo at home. During the study, technical support will be available to ensure that the Echo is properly installed and there are no technical barriers to its use. We will also offer subscriptions to music streaming services and audiobooks, and access to smart lights which can be turned on using voice commands. If people already have smart televisions installed in the home, we will also offer support to use voice commands for these.
            </p>

            <p>Short interviews carried out before using the Echo will measure independence and use of home technology and a similar interview after the study will provide details of how practices may have changed.
            </p>

            <p>Using the Echo’s recordings, we will use computational analysis techniques to describe the content and accuracy of interactions with the Echo. We hope that these analyses will enable us to measure subtle changes in memory and verbal skills over a prolonged period within the home.
